Orthanc Server Configuration
==============================

The primary function is to establish the connection between Orthanc's DICOM servers and GNU Health. The label of a server is a name that the user can choose to represent the server directly. The domain field contains the full web address (URL) to the Orthanc server. This helps GNU Health to find the correct server to connect to. The user must also provide a username and password to log in to the Orthanc server. 

The image below displays a snapshot of the Orthanc module:

Radiology
=========

This section presents the core aspect of the Orthanc integration. It is designed for uploading and updating patient images and for viewing the images using special Orthanc DICOM viewers. The image below displays a snapshot of the radiology module:

Data Models for image data
--------------------------

In this module we have developed three data models to organise image study data according to the DICOM format. These models represent studies, series within studies (such as CT, MR or PET scans) and the individual instances within each series. They represent the relationships between these elements. For example, a single patient may undergo multiple studies, each study may consist of multiple series, and each series may contain multiple instances.


Patient Orthanc Study
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. class:: health_radiology.PatientOrthancStudy(ModelSQL, ModelView)

    This class, `PatientOrthancStudy`, defines a model for radiology study.

    :param ModelSQL: Inherit from the Tryton ModelSQL class for SQL database operations.
    :type ModelSQL: class: ``trytond.model.ModelSQL``

    :param ModelView: Inherit from the Tryton ModelView class for user interface operations.
    :type ModelView: class: ``trytond.model.ModelView``

    Here's a brief description of each method:
    
    - ``__setup__()``: Sets up the class with additional buttons for deleting a study and selecting a viewer.

    - ``get_gnu_patient()``: Retrieves the GNU patient with the given name.

    - ``ohif_viewer_link()``: Generates a URL for the OHIF viewer and study.
    
    - ``ohif_viewer_link()``: Generates a URL for the OHIF viewer and study.

    - ``delete_study()``: Deletes a study record from the Orthanc server.

    - ``update_studies()``: Updates the studies in the GNU Health database by fetching studies from the Orthanc servers and creating new studies if needed.


Study Series
^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. class:: health_radiology.radiology_study_series(ModelSQL, ModelView)

    This class definition is for the ``Study Series`` in the ``gnuhealth.radiology`` module.
